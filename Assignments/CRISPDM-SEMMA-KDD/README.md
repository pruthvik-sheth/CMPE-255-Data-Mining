## Assignment: Data Science Methodologies - CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD

### Overview

This assignment showcases the application of three prominent data science methodologies: **CRISP-DM**, **SEMMA**, and **KDD**. Each methodology has its own dedicated subdirectory containing a unique project using a different dataset..

The project demonstrates a full, phase-by-phase application of each methodology, with detailed analysis, code, and artifacts.


### Methodologies Breakdown

- **CRISP-DM**: Detailed application of all phases (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment). The dataset is analyzed and the results are critically evaluated using GPT-4.
  
- **SEMMA**: Applied using SAS software. Each phase (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess) is fully demonstrated, and results are validated through critical feedback from GPT-4 and manual code verification.
  
- **KDD**: Comprehensive use of the KDD process, from Data Selection to Knowledge Discovery, with detailed analysis and deployment of the final model. Each phase is critiqued and revised using GPT-4 feedback.


### Tools Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and modeling (with required packages listed in each `requirements.txt`).
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For critiquing and improving the methodology execution at each phase.
- **LaTeX**: For writing the research papers in `.tex` format.
