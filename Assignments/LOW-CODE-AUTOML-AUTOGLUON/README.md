# LOW CODE AUTOML - AutoGluon Assignments

This project contains a series of AutoGluon tutorials demonstrating various applications across text, image, tabular, and multimodal data tasks. These notebooks are organized to help you understand how to implement low-code AutoML solutions using AutoGluon for various use cases, such as Kaggle competitions, image classification, text classification, and more.

## Folder Structure

- `A_AutoGluon_for_Kaggle_Competitions/`
  - Example colabs demonstrating the use of AutoGluon for Kaggle competitions.
  
- `B_Text_Classification/`
  - This folder covers text classification tasks like sentiment analysis, sentence similarity, and named entity recognition.

- `D_Image_Classifier/`
  - Notebooks focused on image classification, zero-shot classification, and object detection.

- `E_Image_Segmentation/`
  - Tutorials related to image segmentation, document classification, and PDF classification.

- `F_Semantic_Matching/`
  - Notebooks covering different semantic matching tasks between text and images.

- `G_Multi_Modal_Usecases/`
  - Demonstrations of using AutoGluon for multimodal tasks, including text, tabular, and images.

- `H_Object_Detection/`
  - Time series forecasting and object detection using AutoGluon.

- `I_Tabular_Classification-Regression/`
  - Focused on AutoGluonâ€™s capabilities for tabular data classification and regression.
