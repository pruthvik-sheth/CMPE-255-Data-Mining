# Data Processing and Modeling Assignment

This repository contains solutions for a data processing and modeling assignment, involving two Kaggle datasets: one tabular and one time series. Each dataset undergoes detailed EDA, data cleaning, clustering, anomaly detection, and machine learning model building using AutoML.

## Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing & EDA**: Comprehensive cleaning, transformation, and visual analysis using manual and Auto EDA.
2. **Clustering & Anomaly Detection**: Grouping and outlier removal, along with feature engineering.
3. **Model Building with AutoML**: Multiple models created with AutoML to find the best-performing solution.
