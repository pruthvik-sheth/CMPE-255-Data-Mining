# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

This repository demonstrates various dimensionality reduction techniques using both image and tabular datasets. Each technique is implemented in Google Colab and Databricks, with detailed commentary and interactive visualizations where applicable. The results of each technique are analyzed and compared in the respective sections.

## Goals of the Assignment

1. Explore and demonstrate various dimensionality reduction techniques.
2. Use diverse datasets (image and tabular) to show the versatility of these techniques.
3. Provide interactive visualizations for t-SNE and UMAP.
4. Compare and analyze the results of different techniques.

## Techniques Covered

1. Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
2. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
3. ISOMAP
4. UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
5. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
6. Randomized PCA
7. Kernel PCA
8. Incremental PCA
9. Factor Analysis
10. Autoencoders

## Instructions

Each subtask is placed in a separate folder:

- `image/`: Contains examples of dimensionality reduction applied to image datasets.
- `tabular/`: Contains examples of dimensionality reduction applied to tabular datasets.
- `databricks/`: Contains implementations of dimensionality reduction techniques in Databricks.
